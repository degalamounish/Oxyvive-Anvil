      Under normal circumstances, oxygen is absorbed into circulation when we breathe and transported throughout the body only by red blood cells.  Under pressure, oxygen can be dissolved into all of the body’s fluids, the plasma, the lymphatic system, the central nervous system fluids, and the bone. This allows us to dissolve, transport and deliver many more times the normal oxygen to our tissues and cells.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the quality of life of the patient in many areas. Many conditions such as PTSD and stroke have responded favorably to hyperbaric treatment.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the  quality of life of the patient in many areas.

          Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a treatment in which a patient breathes air or varying amounts of oxygen while inside a pressurized chamber, the pressure being anything above 1 atmosphere.

          The healing power of oxygen is not something new. The use of hyperbaric therapy dates back nearly 350 years. The very first hyperbaric chamber was created in 1662 with the clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy starting in the mid 1800s. During the 1960s, studies began to show a wide variety of beneficial uses for HBOT therapy. Today, there are over 150 internationally approved conditions for which hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to be effective and beneficial.

          Hyperbarics is a safe alternative to many medical treatment options offered to patients today. Some hyperbaric patients may report some mild ear pressure discomfort. This discomfort is similar to the pressure felt when ascending or descending in an airplane. Discuss these concerns with your physician and hyperbaric therapy professional.

          Our clinics provide a safe, comfortable and welcoming environment for your hyperbaric therapy needs. We have hard and soft sided chambers in our offices and offer mild to high pressure depending on the needs of our patients.

          No. Keep in mind that the ’40 hour protocol’ is the gold standard for many of the physiological benefits that have been observed with HBOT. However, the actual physiological benefits (for HBOT) can be seen in just a few sessions!
          Most physiological benefits will begin within the first few sessions of HBOT. It has been well documented that the anti-oxidant and protective role of HBOT is immediate and demonstrated within 24 hours of just one hyperbaric session. Further to this, the anti-inflammatory response is quite also very quick and a strong physiological response has been shown within 4 days of hyperbaric therapy. Many studies have reported HBOT to produce a strong pain relieving effect after just 5 to 10 sessions. HBOT’s effects on promoting new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) can take place in just 10 to 20
          sessions. From our data, here is a general summary:
          1-5 sessions: Improve cellular energy and during this time tissue functioning may be optimized. Those with residual carbon monoxide (ie smokers) or with mild anemia can show immediate benefits with cellular energy. Inflammatory markers can go down considerably and mark the beginning of a natural repair process.
          5-10 sessions: Typically used for acute injuries with soft tissue damage, particularly if there is pain involved.
          10-20 sessions: More serious acute injuries or chronic injuries
          20-40 sessions: Commonly used for major tissue damages and when new tissue is required (through HBOT’s regenerative stem cell properties)

          While it’s easy to see certain physical changes over time, some aren’t so easy to spot like your mental changes. As you get older, your brain goes through several changes that can have a minor impact on your thinking and memory skills. For instance, multitasking may become more difficult. And, you may find that it’s easier to forget familiar names or words.

          Another physical change you’ll go through as you age has to do with your teeth. As you get older, it’s common to experience tooth loss. Plus, your gums may begin pulling back from your teeth. If you’re on medication, you may be impacted by dry mouth more, which can lead to an increased risk of infection or tooth decay.

          Your eyes and ears go through changes through the aging process. By middle age, your eyes start to weaken. The most telling sign is that it’s hard to focus on objects that are close up. You may become a bit more sensitive to light. Some people even find their vision slightly clouded or blurry caused by cataracts.

Natural oils found within your skin decrease in production which makes the skin drier. Age spots and small growths like skin tags become more common as well."
